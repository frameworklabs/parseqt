parseqt
=======

A simple Qt based API library for the [Parse](http://parse.com) cloud service.


To be able to use the Parse cloude service for BlackBerry 10 devices, I started with this rudimentary Qt library.

Currently only parts of the ParseObject and ParseQuery classes are supported.

As the Qt API follows the iOS or Android Parse APIs, the hope is that parseqt can get along without much documentation on its own.

Please consult for now the example project for how to use parseqt.
